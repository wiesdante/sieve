## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- **Duplicate Remover** tool: paste lines, remove repeated ones and copy the result, all inside the app.
  - Keeps the first occurrence of every line, in its original form and position.
  - Options: case-insensitive matching (with correct Turkish İ/i handling), ignoring
    whitespace differences, removing empty lines, writing normalised output, sorting.
  - Statistics (total, empty, removed, unique) and a list of repeated lines with their counts.
  - Runs in the background with progress and cancel, so large lists don't freeze the window.
- Per-tool preferences are remembered between sessions.

### Changed

- The startup smoke test now opens every tool page.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Desktop application shell with sidebar navigation and a dark theme.
- Tool registry so each scraping workflow can be added as its own page.
- Settings page with encrypted GitHub token storage, proxy list, rotation mode and proxy health check.
- Automatic update check on startup, with in-app download and silent installation of new releases.
- Windows installer (per-user, no administrator rights required).
- Release pipeline that builds, smoke-tests and publishes the installer whenever the version is bumped.
